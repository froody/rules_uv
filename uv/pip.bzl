    Produce targets to compile a requirements.in or pyproject.toml file into a requirements.txt file.

    Args:
        name: name of the primary compilation target.
        src: (optional, default "//:requirements.in") a label for the requirements.in file.
            May also be provided as a list of strings which represent the requirements file lines.
        srcs: (optional, default []) a list of labels for requirements.in files.
            These files will be concatenated together in the order they are provided.
        requirements_txt: (optional, default "//:requirements.txt") a label for the requirements.txt file.
        python_platform: (optional) a uv pip compile compatible value for --python-platform.
        target_compatible_with: (optional) specify that a particular target is compatible only with certain
          Bazel platforms.
        args: (optional) override the default arguments passed to uv pip compile, default arguments are:
           --generate-hashes  (Include distribution hashes in the output file)
           --emit-index-url   (Include `--index-url` and `--extra-index-url` entries in the generated output file)
           --no-strip-extras  (Include extras in the output file)
        data: (optional) a list of labels of additional files to include
        tags: (optional) tags to apply to the generated test target
        **kwargs: (optional) other fields passed through to all underlying rules

    Targets produced by this macro are:
      [name]: a runnable target that will use requirements_in to generate and overwrite requirements_txt
      [name].update: an alias for [name]
      [name]_test: a testable target that will check that requirements_txt is up to date with requirements_in
